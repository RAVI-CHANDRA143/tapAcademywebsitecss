                    A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team. I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in February. My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming languages from scratch.

                <p>
                    Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job. Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.

                    After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills, and my knowledge of core Java has also improved. I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA. Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.

                    I got placed in Ribbon Communication in the Cybersecurity role with an 8 LPA package. Enrolling at TAP Academy was one of the best decisions for my career. The teachers at TAP Academy are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. The dedicated TAI platform for coding and the LMS for learning materials have been instrumental in my growth.

                    I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch. Tap Academy stands out for its excellent trainers who provide in-depth coverage of programming and OOPS concepts, highly valuable for placements. I got placed by Avasoft as a Trainee Engineer with a package of 5 LPA through college placement, and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's incredible teaching.
